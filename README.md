### Core Technologies
- PHP 8.4.4
- PostgreSQL 17.4
- Nginx 1.27.4
- Node 23.9
- Docker Compose v2

### Frameworks
- Symfony v7.2+
- Vue.js v3.5+

### Setup
To set up the project you should [have](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) Docker Compose v2 installed on your system.

1. Make the app's bash script `chmod +x core` executable
2. Run the `./core app:setup` command
   - After initial setup â€” you can use `./core app:start`
   - Run `./core app:stop` to stop the containers
3. Visit http://localhost:5173 to interact with the application

It's recommended to run the application through containers as they are prepared with the necessary  
dockerized environments to run it without issues on any host machine.

Please note that ports `5173`, `8000` and `5432` on the host machine should  
be freed as they are being used by the containers.


### Automated testing (WIP)

There are currently some tests covering key functionality and edge cases.  
More to come soon. You can execute `./core tests:run` to run these tests.
